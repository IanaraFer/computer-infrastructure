I had used the terminal cmd to create the new file now.txt
1 - Navigate to the directory: cd data
will show data file
Append the current date and time to now.txt:
date >> now.txt
Repeat the command ten times: You can do this using a loop if you want to automate:
for i in {1..10}; do date >> now.txt; done
Verify the content:
more now.txt
This will append the current date and time to now.txt ten times and let you view the results. Make sure youâ€™re in the correct directory before running these commands!
